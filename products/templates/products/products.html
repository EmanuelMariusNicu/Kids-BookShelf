        <p class="mt-4">A non-fiction book is one that tells you facts and information about the world around you. It can cover almost any topic, from wild animals to Vikings. If it's about something that really happened or something that really exists, it is non-fiction. Some non-fiction books have illustrations (pictures) as well as words.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Why printed books are better for children?
            Parents talked more to their children with children in turn responding to them more while reading the print version, according to the study in Pediatrics. Children more prone to emotional outbursts also responded to their parents better when reading from a book.</p>
